In Laravel there are some folders which I
expain them one by one.

1. app:
    The mejority your application's logic will be there.
Inside app folder:
    In exception folder we define PHP exception.
2. Public:
    Everything which, is accessable in are in public folder. like images, html and the index page.
3. Routh folder: This is where we put all paths of the website.

4. In order to run the Laravel Project just type 'php artisan serve' in the terminal.


MVC stands for Model, View and Controller.

1. Model: Handle data logic und intraction with databse.

2. View: What should be shown to the user (HTML and CSS code/ Blade file).

3. Controller: Handle requests

'php artisan make:controller DashboardController'
Instead of creating a Controller manually, you can use artisan, which is a tool
to make it happen.


4. There is an HTML structure which I'd like to reuese it in some pages too.
    But writing it in every page is just boiler plate code.
    There is an option defing the @yield('content') in the  content section, which is visible on Internet.away
    You should create a blade file in a folder to reuse it anytime.
        E.g.
            <div class="container py-4">
            {{-- Page contens is in this section --}}
            @yield('content')
            </div>

        I created a page called Terms. Instead of writing all the code inside it, I used the yield function.
            E.g.
                @extends('layout.layout')  //extend function
                @section('content')  //name of the yield
                <h1>Terms</h1>
                <div>
                    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consetetur sadipscing elitr, sed diam nonumy eirmod tempor invidunt ut labore et dolore magna
                </div>
                @endsection
                In order to put the Terms to be in the container py-4, then define it inside the content section.

5. What is @Include(''):
    As an example I to make my code more readable and concise, I crated a file inside the layout folder and then
    I cut the nave section and paste it in nav.blade.php.
    In order to use it in your codes, you have to mention it in @Include('layout.nav'). Laravel adds it to your code
    automatically.

6. In order to chage the name of the application eather you can type it manueally or go the .env file and change the APP_NAME.
    In config folder there is a file called app.php. There is env function which reads the app name of Laravel.
        E.g.
            'name' => env('APP_NAME', 'Laravel'),

7. Instead of typing the name of the application in <title>Twitter Clone Bootstrap 5 Example</title> you can do it dynamically.
        E.g.
            <title>{{ config('app.name')}}</title>
            In the config folder there is a file named app and inside app there is a method named name.
                'name' => env('APP_NAME', 'Laravel'),
