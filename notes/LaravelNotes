In Laravel there are some folders which I
expain them one by one.

1. app:
    The mejority your application's logic will be there.
Inside app folder:
    In exception folder we define PHP exception.
2. Public:
    Everything which, is accessable in are in public folder. like images, html and the index page.
3. Routh folder: This is where we put all paths of the website.
