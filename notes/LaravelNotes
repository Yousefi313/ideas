In Laravel there are some folders which I
expain them one by one.

1. app:
The mejority your application's logic will be there.
Inside app folder:
In exception folder we define PHP exception.
2. Public:
Everything which, is accessable in are in public folder. like images, html and the index page.
3. Routh folder: This is where we put all paths of the website.

4. In order to run the Laravel Project just type 'php artisan serve' in the terminal.


MVC stands for Model, View and Controller.

1. Model: Handle data logic und intraction with databse.

2. View: What should be shown to the user (HTML and CSS code/ Blade file).

3. Controller: Handle requests

'php artisan make:controller DashboardController'
Instead of creating a Controller manually, you can use artisan, which is a tool
to make it happen.


4. There is an HTML structure which I'd like to reuese it in some pages too.
But writing it in every page is just boiler plate code.
There is an option defing the @yield('content') in the content section, which is visible on Internet.away
You should create a blade file in a folder to reuse it anytime.
E.g.
<div class="container py-4">
    {{-- Page contens is in this section --}}
    @yield('content')
</div>

I created a page called Terms. Instead of writing all the code inside it, I used the yield function.
E.g.
@extends('layout.layout') //extend function
@section('content') //name of the yield
<h1>Terms</h1>
<div>
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consetetur sadipscing elitr, sed diam nonumy eirmod tempor invidunt ut labore et dolore magna
</div>
@endsection
In order to put the Terms to be in the container py-4, then define it inside the content section.

5. What is @Include(''):
As an example I to make my code more readable and concise, I crated a file inside the layout folder and then
I cut the nave section and paste it in nav.blade.php.
In order to use it in your codes, you have to mention it in @Include('layout.nav'). Laravel adds it to your code
automatically.

6. In order to chage the name of the application eather you can type it manueally or go the .env file and change the APP_NAME.
In config folder there is a file called app.php. There is env function which reads the app name of Laravel.
E.g.
'name' => env('APP_NAME', 'Laravel'),

7. Instead of typing the name of the application in <title>Twitter Clone Bootstrap 5 Example</title> you can do it dynamically.
E.g.
<title>{{ config('app.name')}}</title>
In the config folder there is a file named app and inside app there is a method named name.
'name' => env('APP_NAME', 'Laravel'),

8. How to create Migration using artisan:
php artisan make:migration create_ideas_table
The underline is the naming convintion.


9. There are two kind of Routes in Laravel:

a. Direct Closure Route:
Direct Closure Route (Route::get('/terms', function () { return view('terms'); });):
Best for simple, static routes with minimal logic.

b. Controller Route:
Controller Route (Route::get('/profile', [ProfileController::class, 'index']);):
Best for complex logic, reusability, and maintaining clean separation of concerns.


10. In order to create table in Database, you can use the following command.
php artisan:make migration create_ideas_table

And then you can edit the migration by adding more coloumns.

And then type in the terminal the following command.away
php artisan:migrate


11. Route::post('/idea', [DashboardController::class, 'index']);
The above line of code is a route, there is an option of naming you route too.

Route::post('/idea', [DashboardController::class, 'index'])->name('idea.create');
The name of above route is idea.create


In order to make a model you type
php artisan make:model Comment

You can create migration and controller with the same command line.
There is another option of creating them all together by typing:
php artisan make:model Comment -m -c

m stands for migration and c stands for controller.

$fillable and $guarded are the same with some differences. Google about $validated too.
    e.g.  Idea::create($validate);

I should start from #20 Registration code.
I'm still in #20. I did everything but at the end
it give me an error route[register] not defined..
