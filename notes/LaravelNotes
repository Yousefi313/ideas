In Laravel there are some folders which I
expain them one by one.

1. app:
    The mejority your application's logic will be there.
Inside app folder:
    In exception folder we define PHP exception.
2. Public:
    Everything which, is accessable in are in public folder. like images, html and the index page.
3. Routh folder: This is where we put all paths of the website.

4. In order to run the Laravel Project just type 'php artisan serve' in the terminal.


MVC stands for Model, View and Controller.

1. Model: Handle data logic und intraction with databse.

2. View: What should be shown to the user (HTML and CSS code/ Blade file).

3. Controller: Handle requests

'php artisan make:controller DashboardController'
Instead of creating a Controller manually, you can use artisan, which is a tool
to make it happen.
